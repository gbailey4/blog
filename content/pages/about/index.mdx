Hi!

I'm a Product Management and Marketing professional with a background in technology companies, startups, and multifamily. Most recently I was the Product Manager for Knock Rentals - owning the reporting and data services products. Prior to that I lead the marketing and product development organizations at a mid-size property management firm - Horizon Realty Advisors.

I have specialized in the technical side of those roles, leadership, and data analysis.

I'm currently open for consulting work and blogging about personal projects here. If you'd like to talk to me or work together, please don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact)!
